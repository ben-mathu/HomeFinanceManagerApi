        After login, the user is redirected to the dashboard where they are taken through a couple of modals. First the user is prompted to add income, which can be cancelled to be done at a later time and therefore not optional; then the user is prompted to add at least one expense, this can also be cancelled and can be done at a later time.

        Dashboard
        The dashboard is a part of the user interface that displays processed data and information retrieved from the database. The dashboard design provides the user an at-a-glance view of key performance indicators (KPIs), in this case user expenditure and monthly profit, expenses (paid or unpaid expenses), pie chart showing how much each expense contributes to the total expenses amount; and transactions.

        Perform Transactions (Paying for expenses)
        As easily as add expense schedules, the notification area lists expenses that the user has already been notified and/or missed the notification that shows at the bottom right of the dashboard.

        Click on any of the expenses to transact or pay for your expense. You can also perform a transaction when you click the accept button on the payment notification in the bottom right section of the application, as illustrated in the image above.

        Account settings, preferences and accessibility
        The account settings can be found when you select the gear icon in the left section of the application (the navigation bar). Users can add, delete and manage their account and application preferences from this area.

        The user can also share their household invite code so that users from their household can join.
